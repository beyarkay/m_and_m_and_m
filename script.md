[Speaking to camera]
Do you know someone who just _doesn't_ reply to your emails? Maybe a colleague,
a Namibian Prince, or that really cute girl at the party who wouldn't give you
her number but was okay will letting you know her email address was
`meganfox123@gmail.com`.

Well I've built the perfect robot to give to the meganfox123's of your life. 

[view of the robot on the workbench with m&m's and dogecoin stickers]
It feeds you m&m's if you answer your emails, and threatens you with violence
if I don't / threatens to buy dogecoin if I don't.

[basic drawing of how it works]
The idea is that, Gmail is gonna send a message to this little robot, which
will turn on this motor which is connected to this 3D printed m&m container
which will drop one m&m onto my desk.

Alternatively, if I've still got unreplied emails in my inbox at midnight,
then the robot will take my money throw it away into something useless like
dogecoin.

[speaking to camera]
If you're interested in seeing how I built the thing, drop a comment down
below. But in summary:

[speaking to camera]
And with exactly no problems at all, it's done!
